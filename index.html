      <p><strong>Welcome.</strong></p>
      <img src="./pics/ePhoto.jpg", width=240 , alt="ePhoto", align="right", style="margin:10px 10px">
      <p>I am a PhD student at the 
      <a href="https://sgs.ihu.edu.tr/en">School of Graduate Studies</a> at 
      <a href="https://www.ihu.edu.tr/en">Ibn Haldun University</a> and Research Fellow at  <a href="https://avrasya.ihu.edu.tr/en">
       </p>
      
      <p> Before joining Waseda, I was a Climate Change Researcher at <a href="https://www.impact-initiatives.org/">IMPACT Initiatives</a> where I supervised the Community-based monitoring (CBM) of the STREAM programme. </p>
      
      <p> I obtained a BS in International Relations from the
      <a href="https://manas.edu.kg/en">Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University</a> 
      (2022) and a MA in <a href="https://www.osce-academy.net/en/programmes/masters/ps/">Politics and Security</a> from 
      <a href="https://www.osce-academy.net/">OSCE Academy in Bishkek</a>, where
      I received OSCE Academy's Full MA Scholarship from the year 2022 to 2024. My doctoral dissertation won the John T. I also recieved a grant to conduct fieldwork at Heydar Aliyev Center for Eurasian Studies in 2023, as a Visiting Research Fellow. </p>
      
      <p>I am broadly interested in the development of quantitative methods 
      for political science data.  My research has focused on statistical
      methods for causal inference, including causal attribution, causal mediation, 
      causal moderation, and causal inference with measurement error.
      I also study experimental designs and survey methodology, with empirical applications to 
      elections and comparative political behavior. </p>
      
      <p>My work has appeared in various academic journals, such as
      <a href="http://www.ajps.org/"><i>American Journal of Political Science</i></a>,
      <a href="http://www.apsanet.org/content_3222.cfm"><i>American
      Political Science Review</i></a>,
      <a href="https://amstat.tandfonline.com/loi/uasa20">
      <i>Journal of the American Statistical Association</i></a>,
      <a href="http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/">
      <i>Political Analysis</i></a>,
      and <a href="http://www.pnas.org/">
      <i>PNAS</i></a>. I have won several awards for my research and professional work, including the <i>Emerging Scholar Award</i> (2019) from the Society for Political Methodology. My work has been supported by the National Science Foundation. </p>
